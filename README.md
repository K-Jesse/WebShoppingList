# Shoppinglist App

## App for keeping track of your shopping needs in one place.

Alpha Version
Very barebones listing features. Everything *should* be functional. This project was done within 24 hours and limited knowledge of Python and Django, so there is alot to be improved.


Made with Django framwork and the knowledge form course by Tero Karvinen: https://terokarvinen.com/2021/python-web-service-from-idea-to-production-2022/

Also used few fellow students (more advanced i might add) material as guidance:

This demo has been tested by a grand total of 1 test person (which is not me) without guidance, so i'm assuming it's pretty usable.
